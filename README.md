👋 Hi, I’m @d0minnik, a passionate developer with a focus on web technologies and a strong interest in full-stack development.
👀 I’m interested in learning new programming languages, exploring cutting-edge technologies, and creating innovative solutions to complex problems.
🌱 I’m currently learning more advanced topics in JavaScript (Vue.js, Nuxt.js), PHP, and Laravel, while deepening my understanding of software architecture and best practices.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting open-source projects, web applications, and any opportunities that allow me to leverage my skills while learning from others.
📫 Feel free to reach out to me here via GitHub or through my personal contact information if you’d like to collaborate or discuss new projects!


Wishing you a great day ahead! :)
